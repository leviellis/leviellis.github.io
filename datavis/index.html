        My term project is a web-based data visualization tool that allows users
        to compare the popularity of topical social justice-related search terms
        across different regional demographics within the United States. As it is
        developed so far, my program is a functional prototype based on projects
        from my computer science major that processes search data from Google
        compressed into CSV files. This map shows the popularity percentage of the
        search term "black lives matter" during the year 2021. Each state is visually
        represented with a dot on the map of the US which is sized to reflect the
        stateâ€™s population, and mousing over that dot shows the relative popularity
        of the search term using Washingtin DC's results as the constant variable (100%).
