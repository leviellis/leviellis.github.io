For my project, I attempted to take a different 
approach at data visualization by integrating 
an auditory representation of my data set.

I choose to work with Google Trends data 
concerning the popularity of search terms 
relating to the BLM movement in the week 
leading up to the election.

Each search term is represented by a different
instrument - piano, cello, or violin - visualized 
in the form of a red, blue, or yellow note 
respectively.

As time progresses, the notes in the piano roll
scroll down. The higher notes represent the times
the search term was more popular while times where
the search term was less popular are represented
by a lower note.
